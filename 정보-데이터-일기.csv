"For the past few years, many people have been turning to vegetarians. Some people are forced to become vegetarian because of their health conditions, some people just simply can't eat meat due to their religion, but these are all individual choices and must be respected. However, I believe that environmental issues are the main reason for the increasing number of vegetarians in modern society."
"Exactly two years ago, society was in a period of great chaos. The virus from China which nowadays we call ""Covid-19"" or ""Coronavirus"" attacked people indiscriminately, and the damage caused by it was enormous. People kept dying, and the economy was going down as well. However, the virus made humanity realize the value of life. In India, the Himalayas had not been seen for over a century, but within a week of people being quarantined, a miraculous thing happened, in which the Himalayas were visible. miracles happen all over the world and this clearly shows how much humans have destroyed nature."
"Humans are destroying the environment and the ecosystem at the same time. As result, meat consumption could appear as a threat. To eat meat people need to kill various animals along the lines of cows, pigs, and chickens from then on they will take the flesh and cook it. Therefore, animals that contain high nutrients like cows are killed by above 320 million annually and the number of cows being livestock at this point in time is more than 1 billion. Beyond 70% of them live on a factory farm and they are not allowed to nurse their babies or even socialize with their herds. These poor conditions cause pollution from animal waste and methane gas which directly impacts the environment."
"Vegetarian food often gets questioned about the quality and nutrients. There are plenty of appetizing recipes that are on social media. Hence, the options and the quality of food are unlimited. Vegetarianism and veganism are completely different. A vegan diet excludes all meat and animal products so they do not eat cheese, milk, or eggs. However, vegetarians can eat fish, cheese, milk, and eggs. A vegetarian diet could lower levels of saturated fat, and animal protein as well as higher levels of carbohydrates, vitamins C and E, and phytochemicals. In spite of the fact that a vegetarian diet offers several nutritional benefits, vegetarian food items contain more protein compared to non-vegetarian food items therefore, it can lead to other kinds of diseases."
"To sum up, everything that has been stated environmental issues are the main factor in vegetarianism trending. I was able to know that people are actively thinking about the earth's environmental problems and hopefully these eco-friendly activities will continue in the future."
